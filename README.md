# load_LAXO
Some load tests for Laxo.one

I'm learning load testing right now. 
I donâ€™t fully understand how exactly the simulation of real users works in tools like Locust, so I want to compare how the server will feel when working with 100 pre-defined real user accounts with unique IDs and passwords and when working with 100 simulated users created based on one HttpUser class

Later I will attach charts and statistics made by Locust Web interface with results of both these situations
